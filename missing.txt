These are parts that I skipped (e.g. learned on Shabbos and haven't been able to fill in after Shabbos)

From the beginning of Bereishit up through sheini of Chayei Sarah

In Bo:
    Vayis'u (יב לז)
    Zot chukat hapasach (יב מג)
    Kadesh (יג א)
   
In Beshalach:
    The Malbim doesn't discuss the aggadeta parts of the Mechilta.
      They print it in the Chumash, but the Malbim only talks about the pesukim.
      I'm not planning to index it here.
