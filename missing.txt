These are parts that I skipped (e.g. learned on Shabbos and haven't been able to fill in after Shabbos)

From the beginning of Bereishit up through sheini of Chayei Sarah

In Bo:
    Vayis'u (יב לז)
    Zot chukat hapasach (יב מג)
    Kadesh (יג א)
   
In Beshalach:
    The Malbim doesn't discuss the aggadeta parts of the Mechilta.
      They print it in the Chumash, but the Malbim only talks about the pesukim.
      I'm not planning to index it here.

In Yitro:
    Up to the aseret hadibrot, unfortunately.  I need to get ahead because Mishpatim is really long.
      There are some really nice and really important pieces there though.  I need to go back at some point.
    Also the Mechilta is like in Beshalach, up to maftir

In Mishpatim:
    Most of eved ivri and all of amah ivriyah
    Shomer sachar, shoel, and socher
    Shishi and shevii, unfortunately.  There's some fundamental stuff there.

In Terumah:
    From partway (!) through the parsha of the yeriot to the end
    In Rimzei Hamishkan:
        From the yeriot to the end
    Rimzei Chatzar Hamishkan Vehamizbeyach
    
In Tetzaveh:
    Rishon through Shlishi
    Rimzei Bigdei Hakodesh

In Ki Tisa:
    From לב טו to the end

The whole Vayakhel (there's not much Malbim)

In Pekudei:
    The last pasuk, saved for Taanit Bechorot

Ayelet Hashachar

In Vayikra:
    From the bottom of page 5, which is in the middle of siman ד, through siman כט
    From siman צג through קלה
    From siman קצז through רמט
